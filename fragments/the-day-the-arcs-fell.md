The morning it all ended, I vowed never to be weak again.

</div>

Over plains tired as the setting sun, I fly, a songbird aboard Alveria's grandest airship.

<div class="monospace">

That morning, I had collapsed before Charlotte's father, my last memory being that of his eyes full of that pity which I hated so much.

</div>

This airship, the *Halcyon*, hosts several theatricals throughout the trip. Charlotte is performing tonight. *15P*, my ticket reads. I quietly take my seat next to a large man as he argues with his wife in *15N*.

"Something different," I sighed.

</div>

"Freedom," Charlotte cried.

<div class="monospace">

And so I had run—broken myself free of Nathaniel's grasp. Upon the northern star I had set my eyes, knowing it to be my only guide to *Vita Nuova,* my only chance to a new life.

</div>

I was flung from my seat, hitting my head on the seat just ahead.

Two bodies and nothing more, we fall and fall, the sunglow of dawn the only illumination upon your freezing irises. The feeling—it's not love, the type that you fall into. No—whatever I'm feeling, its something that makes me float.

<div class="monospace">

You came, an eigengrau shadow amidst the darkness, the cool rays of the moon illuminating only your jade eyes. I had wished it would be you to witness me ascend—that it would be you to take my life away and birth me anew.

</div>

Over plains golden as the rising sun, we fly, songbirds uncaged, singing of a delicate freedom.

<div class="monospace">

The night it all began, you were the only one by my side.

</div>
