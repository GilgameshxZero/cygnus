*Just a few cases,* they kept on saying. But it turns out diseases are kind of like what my mother had said of love: *both of you are reading the same bookâ€”it's okay to be a few chapters behind.* No one had realized how short the chapters of coronavirus were until it was too late.

Yesterday, we had been packing for a spring break trip to Erlija. Today, we packed everything else. Tomorrow, the number of cases at the Academy would double yet again after only just six days. And the day after that, most students would be on their way back home.

For some of us, home was not so obvious. I, like many others, am a child of the snow. Though the Academy has offered us the potential to petition to quarantine on campus, I am forced to prioritize my own health to quarantine on campus, I am forced to prioritize my own health.
