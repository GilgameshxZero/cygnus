I am not who I was before.

The mornings atop Starfall Tower are dark. This morning, as I peered into the mirror, I saw the same face I had always known. Expressionless, unsmiling, cold. Today, it was just really cold.

I dream of many things for this world. There is no good to come from the war between the Hegemony and the Republic. Day after day, their people and mine alike risk their lives for ideals and hopes which are not so much different. We all chase after happiness.  There's just too little for everyone to be happy.

I dream for my people. They call me the Sovereign and themselves of the Sovereignty. I have tried my best to be just and to be strong. I have built for them a country, a safe harbor from the war of the world. Yet, disease and famine strike us in this remote corner of the world, year after year. I am not who I was before. I can only do so much.

And I dream of Eva. I dream of seeing those cherry blossoms bloom yet again. But Paragon is nowhere for a man like me to go back to. If she was my home, then I would be homeless.

My eyes betray my age. I can dream not much longer. Wherever Eva is, I'm afraid I will never be able to see her again. But there is still one thing I want to do.

I have come to know love. I hope that my children and my people can live on, in peace. Shrouded away from the battles of the land, only in Starfall will they find happiness.
