It had always been November.

Inevitable. Predestined. As the summer months waned and the leaves cooked themselves to a crisp, he was always just around the corner. Engrossed in that little Gameboy of his—*a reminder of happier days*, he had said—he didn't even lift an eye the first time I strolled by. If only I had done the same.

*Regret is for the privileged.* Behind me lies the golden plains of Erlija, stretching all the way to the setting sun. The wind blows tides across the grain, reflecting a beam of light as it moves across the sky like a spotlight shining on the hands the weaver of the clouds. Like waking from a dream, I attempt to cast aside the nagging desire to stay and reminisce. Yet, as I stare into the waves, as their ebb and flow crashes endlessly into my consciousness, I almost give up. *I could stay here forever.*

And so I stay, if only for a moment longer. The splashing of the water draws my attention to the *Avalon* as it bobs up and down. Back and forth and back and forth like a rocking horse toy, it is as majestic as a white stallion carrying a knight in shining armor. But a knight I am not—and alas, no damsel in distress awaits me on the opposite shore. In fact, I have very little idea what awaits me, if I can even make it across.

As I carry over the last of the canned beans from the wagon, I wonder: *will this be enough?* A part of me wishes that November would have prepared the food for me as well. The *Avalon* is not big like the cruise ships, so it cannot store months and months of food and fuel. But I won't need it. Hopefully, this will be over in just under two weeks.

Already having adjusted to the wobble of the ship during loading, I take one last look at Erlija and the now-distant airships patrolling above it. Surprisingly, Al had still not left the dock. I wave, expecting the sound of the whip and the turning of the wheels shortly after, but hear nothing. They must be too far away for sound to travel. As the last traces of light disappear from the sky, the ship begins moving. After hovering over the instruments on the ship's dashboard pretending to have an idea how to operate it, I descend into my room on the lower deck. Amidst the dust particles dancing in and out of visibility, I spot that which I had left unread.

When I was young, I had read a story about a girl named Sophie. A young teenager, she sailed across the ocean with her family to live with her grandfather on the other side. Every night, she would tell them a story that she had heard from her grandfather from his childhood. She would tell them stories of books and bridges and beauties, but they always ended with grandfather close to drowning. He would always slip and fall and slide and end up in the water. When they finally meet the grandfather on the other side, he denies having ever ended the stories with such dangerous scenarios. It turns out Sophie's parents were not her real parents but instead her aunt and uncle. Her real parents had drowned at sea.

I temper my expectations of that which I hold in my hands. November was always one to write sappy notes—was it even that? The note's parchment is rough to the touch. Was it deliberate, a designer's choice? Or, perhaps, that was the only thing he had access to at the time. There are two slips of paper, the outer folded in half over the inner to hide its contents. The crease is not sharp. I unbuckle my boots and slide them off, placing them to the side as I prop my back against the pillow on the bed's backboard. I entertain the thought of having a window of the sea on my right. My imagination will have to do.

I take a deep breath.

*Aria,*

*The airships of Erlija should be out of sight already. They're a wonder—truly, I dared not to imagine that its few propellers could keep an entire airship adrift. But the plains! They've always shined brighter for me. I'm not sure when Al would have taken you across, but I hope it wasn't during the day. Trust me, they're a lot prettier in the dark.*

*Apologies. I had promised myself not to erase anything I wrote, so that introduction will have to do. On one hand, I have given all my most important instructions to Al, whom you've already met. On the other hand, I feel as if getting you to Blackfeather isn't my top priority anymore. Hopefully, it's yours now.*

*When I think of the ocean, and when I think of you, I can't help but remember those days back in Fonte. As soon as lunch started, I would look for you in the cafeteria. When school ended, I would follow you to the pool. We would wait in the lobby, while you let me play through the Scribblenauts games on your Nintendo DS. And when swim practice ended—our parents would pick us up, and I would pray that I would see you at school tomorrow morning. And I would, lest it be a weekend. But, that Wednesday night, do you remember? When you ran into me by the creek?*

*That night, I died for the first time.*

And so, too, did I.
