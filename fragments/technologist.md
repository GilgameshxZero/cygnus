# Technologist

It is the faint humming of the fans and pumps, the evaporation and dripping of millions of water particles trapped in a vapor chamber, which defines the realm of the physical as it weaves in and out of his mind, underneath a Deneb so luminous, so perfect, it could only be a projection from the astrophysical. Indeed, a projection it was, for he was one of the *gifted,* plucked so delicately from the trillions of humans, in recognition of his dream which could only be described as one in a million. It is a dream wrought from the confines of what the world defines as modern, a world juiced from dejection, so grand, so pure, that it was bound to be forgotten before recognized. Kept forever hungry by the false projection of the summer triangle upon his ceiling which powers each of the *gifted,* he is a technologist, a creator, and only but. Eyes glued to the ceiling, his hands tire endlessly, working to save the eye of the swan, the last star remaining in his gift.
