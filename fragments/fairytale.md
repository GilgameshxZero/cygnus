The nights were too hot then. We sat on a larger rock by the creek, facing away from each other, dangling our feet just above the roaring water which had suddenly grown so quiet. *November, like the month,* I remember repeating in my head, as if fearing I would forget it come morning. But is it so wrong to be afraid of the dawn? It creeps in slowly but inevitably, drawing to a close each night which would have lasted forever otherwise. And it, like a cancer on the skin of darkness, consumes all the people and stories on the millions of stars so eagerly, leaving behind only a bland light which brings to life the billions of *sunpires,* as you liked to call them.

*They're scared of the night, so they don't leave their houses. But they still need to eat, so they eat dreams instead.* And so do they forget their dreams when they awake. But we're different, aren't we? We're *true* vampires. We hide from the light, swearing to protect the denizens of the night with our lives.

*Like that star?* I asked, pointing at a weary Deneb dragging its feet away from the sun which has chased it for eternity. *Yeah, like the black swan,* you answered from behind me, our gazes converging at a point six thousand light years away. Only years later did I learn of Cygnus, the black swan with a brightest Deneb at its heart. *Like the black swan which flies northward, a fairytale emblazoned on every one of its feathers.* That night, we shared our first fairytale.

"Do you know what love is, Aria?"

I shook my head.

"I don't either. But that's what they look for. You knowâ€”how you always feel like someone's watching you from behind?"

"It's because we're special."
