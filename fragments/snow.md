The sun would shine again.

That's what I told myself, day and night. But the snow kept falling. When winter ended and spring started, it didn't stop. First, it coated everything in a creamy white. I helped shovel out the paths around the village. But it kept snowing. Soon, not only had our work been undone, but the snow on the lawns had stacked even higher. The river froze. A few roofs collapsed. We went atop our houses and pushed snow off before it became a huge problem. When summer came, the river finally unfroze. There was no fish to catch. The snow must have warmed up—it began raining and raining and raining. The terraces near the river flooded, and we waded through the ice-cold water to get from one house to another.

Uncle finally returned during the summer. His feet were black and swollen—he said that they hurt on touch. But after just a week, he recovered. While he was recovering on his bed, he told us stores of Starfall. *All the scientists—smart people, that's what they called them there—were thinking really hard about why the snow was falling. It's a lot worse there, since they're further north. When I left at the beginning of the summer, it was still snowing. But their houses are made of unrustable iron, so it wasn't as big of a problem.* I didn't even know there was iron that wouldn't rust.

Of course, I never stopped coughing. Mother told me to stay indoors. The blizzard was a huge problem for the others, but I just wanted to touch the snow. So I stared into my snow globe and watched it there. But the snow in a snow globe falls much slower, because the globe is filled with water instead of air. So I kept on looking outside.

I wished that I would finally be able to see the sun. But I also wished that the snow would never stop.
