"Would you like help with the boards?"

I do not know why I asked him that day. Like the others, I was in a rush to pack and leave.

His hands stopped briefly. There was still much to erase. He turned his head at me.

"I see you're the last to leave."

Rays of the sunset crept through the blinds to adorn his black Oxfords with a polished glare. Through the drifts of illuminated chalk particles and the familiar smell of mahogany desks, I felt him move his dark eyes from me to the papers in my hand and back to me. It was subtle, but it was deliberate. He observed me like the architects across the courtyard had observed their little white model houses and chairs.

"Why do you think we erase the boards?"

The question caught me off-guard. Reasonably so, as all he had asked me previously had been about applications of the probabilistic method or the generation of Borel algebras.

"Aren't blackboards partially made of egg shells? Is it to avoid degradation by the chalk?"

"No, no," he laughed, "you are overthinking. It is purely out of respect for its next user—a principle never taught but nevertheless expected. But today is different."

*Just a few cases,* they had said. But it turns out diseases are kind of like what my mother had said of love: *both of you are reading the same book—it's okay to be a few chapters behind.* No one had realized how short the chapters of Kana pandemic were until it was too late. The day before the sunset, we had been packing for a spring break trip. That day, we packed everything else. The day after, the number of cases at the Academy would double yet again after only just three days.

"No one's going to be using that board for a while. The black Kana pandemic."

"Yes."

"Why do they call it the Kana?"

It was a child's question. Childless himself, he used to joke that all his students were his children.

"The head scientists name viruses after their origin. In this case, it happened to be the Kana river deep in Dynasty lands. There was talk of calling it the Dynasty virus. Do you know why they didn't do so?"

"I know it is to avoid tensions with the Dynasty government," I said. "But I do not understand. Since the virus came from the Dynasty, shouldn't it be up to their officials to shut it down?"

"Many do not understand either," he sighed, stopping his eraser yet again, this time halfway done with the final blackboard. "But I think of it like this: while I would have appreciated it if your language professor had cleaned the boards before I came in, I cannot teach mathematics on a board littered with foreign symbols. It is still my responsibility to deliver a good lecture, whether that includes erasing the board or not, just as it is the responsibility of the Republic to ensure the health of its citizens."

"Say, what is your name?"

"I'm Aria," I responded, "will I need to know yours?"

"If you ever meet the Magus of Yggdrasil, tell him Zeb sent you."
