# Charlotte

Yang Yan
May's final breath

*Across the high seas,* Charlotte had said,
*across the high seas lies freedom.*

And so she called to me.
*Come in,* she whispered. *Come in,*
the mother of the night sea ushers,
her countless children swimming
to lives they wish they had.

And so Charlotte had given to me
the waves which crash and ebb and roll.
It flows and flows and pulls me back,
back to that day, underneath the cherry blossoms,
as it dangled from her necklace, a world within a world,
a sea within an ocean, one ship and two souls,
struggling against the rocking tide.

*Come back,* it calls, *come back,*
to which I embrace,
*I am right here.*
