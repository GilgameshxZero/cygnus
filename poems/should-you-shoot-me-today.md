Should you shoot me today,
	I wouldn’t be mad.
The dead don’t feel a thing, so
	*should* you shoot me today?
I am twenty-three, and three days ago I was just thirteen,
	a good age, as any, to be shot.

There is culture, and there is revolution,
	there are both, then there is nothing at all.
At the edges of the world, where waterfalls fall down
	into the hungry mouths of stars long dead,
I’m glad I spread my wings, I’m glad I few away.
	But at the end of it all, there is nothing
at all.
