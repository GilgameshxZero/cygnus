# my life.

Listen, let me finish—
&emsp;the word is a snapshot of this
&emsp;life and false lies, I didn’t believe in

&emsp;the waves of demand, not intersecting
&emsp;feminist supply, of bottled ambitions in unit economics
&emsp;terms: inadmissible evidence in the courts

&emsp;of quarterly love, the exaltation of personalities as
&emsp;cardboard, apartments of 1st street-level & 11th street
&emsp;deconstruction of height as privilege, which really is

&emsp;any warmth in cold winter nights, and thus
my sentence.
&emsp;if you will,

&emsp;is to cry, and to scream.
&emsp;The year is 1985.
&emsp;I am negative fourteen years old with a most underweight

&emsp;of bodies, there has always been more supply than
&emsp;demand of doublethink, I believed in
&emsp;J. P. who has more ATMs in this city

&emsp;than square footage in our home.
&emsp;A lot has changed, for both you and me
&emsp;nothing is settled yet, so before

&emsp;these rose petals I’ve flung into the sky,
&emsp;let me take you on a date,
&emsp;so you may take—
