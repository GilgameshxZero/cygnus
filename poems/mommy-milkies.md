The One in Bel-Air, a hundred thousand square feet
a million buys you nothing but houses and spouses
but a single dollar bill from streets of mans and mouses:
(“too black, too poor”)
receipts printed with your words, they bought for me,
a one-way plane ticket to death you could never admit to see.
But I saw.
so that my left eye peers into a clueless childhood full of answers
<span class="align-right-float">so that my right eye paints a meticulous death without questions</span>
so that I would dream of dog walks around the park with you, all too
maskless &
uncomfortable &
embarrassed &
you never listened. you never listened you never listened you never listened you never listened you never listened you never listened you never listened I never listened
to you,
I was just a child who, without you, could not have,

a song of storm and fire, singing suicide in the language of the sakuras.

I would never dare! No, I meant—a normal amount of sugar, of course—a normal amount of *rebirth ideation*, of course!”
