That the sixth station is but across a clearwater repose
whose shoe-deep reflection springs forth from a golden land ahead,
where all our train tracks converged and began,

yes, I don’t remember, but I do
remember hearing a song from three years ago.
From the lights coloring a street corner I heard my destiny
splattered in oil and marinara on *konbini* pasta.
Through thrice-folded glass I asked for the song’s name,
but through broken tongues I could only make out
*a song of three years past.*

Rain pours out from bygone days beneath clear-sky constellations;
an eagle and a swan fought over a single lyre
whose voice echoes between halcyons painted by the golden sunset.
The first snow came on November 15th.
The last train left with you.
