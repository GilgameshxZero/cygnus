<div class="time">

fourteen billion parsecs and
fifty-eight billion years away, is
a girl from a dying humanity:
upon the same pulsar we wish
just 1.3373 seconds apart;
through
a singlar cosmos
two observable universes
at three times the speed of light
do our prayers travel;

<br>

even if no one around hears
by the conservation of energy
our voices will always have each other.

</div><div class="distance">

five thousand, three hundred,
and seven miles away, is
a girl from argentina:
only
one game server
two time zones
three languages
apart;
in just eleven characters
g-o-o-d-n-i-g-h-t-<-3
she—

<br>

is that not enough?

</div><div class="dimension">

three time zones, and
two thousand miles, and
one dimension apart, is
a vtuber named remi:
she loves warm rice;
each
inflection of her voice
breath after laughter
wiggle of her mouse ears
brings me—

<br>

all I know is this:
I may not be able to love her as is;
that is why
I don this mask, to transcend
distance and time and
dimension.
