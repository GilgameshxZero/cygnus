# Magic show

Yang Yan

With a quick ruffle, she produces
the card of my horrors.
Showing, brandishing to all,
she stomps to her volunteer in the crowd.
But it is no volunteerâ€”it is me,
bewildered and unchosen and not unborn.
"Is this your card," she asks.
The crowd cheers and hollers.
With my primary I lift my card,
and my other open my bedroom door.
She asks if I am ready but who would be.
Cards are for dueling, I think
as my card hits a wall and slices my hand into
red and crying and warm and dripping.

"And that's why my hand is wrapped in bandages."
My English teacher pauses, and notes
that I had always written with my right.
And I reply, "No, I am left-handed."

Mother, I do not like magic anymore.
