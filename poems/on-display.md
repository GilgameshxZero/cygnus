A single rose stands amidst a winter wonderland.
The only flower missing from my collection!
She's so special!
Not like the other girls I have

—the other girls with only fronts and backs,
one dimension, two dimensions;
but this one, I make my approach from her side.

*love me, love me not, love me, love me not*

So many petals. So many layers.
A crimson blanket upon freezing cobalt.
So this is what shaved ice tastes like.
So this is what a real girl feels like.

Carefully, now!
Cross-sections only have two dimensions!
Don't ruin her for the scientists!
They're all waiting for her in the living room.
