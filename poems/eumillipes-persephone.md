Fall into me.

I am twenty-three years old.
One meter and seventy-three centimeters and seventy-seven kilograms.
*Ground yourself,* she says,
	*breathe in, breathe out,*
The sand of my memories escapes between my fingers,
	webbing separated by millions of years of evolution.
*and realize that we are all but human,*
	and it is okay for humans to make mistakes.
To feel out of control in this crazy world of ours.

Weeks pass in a blink of an eye.
	The Machine holds my eyes to the screen, for weeks at a time.

I am thirty-five years old.

The sand of my memories escapes between my fingers,
	whose webbing yearns for each other
	across a million years of evolution.
They named it the *eumillipes persephone*, the millipede, with
	a whole 1306 legs, I suppose,
	until one gets snagged in a crevice
	or trench, like the ones they rotted in,
	in the first world war, I suppose.
There are reactions and there are reactions to reactions.
Did he really ride a bear, shirtless?
I’m too scared to say anything.

Remember the *hallucigenia*?

Once in a blue moon.

So the rabbit lived upon the moon, until the last

Until the world’s fair had boiled all of us into soup,
feathers and scales and femurs alike

They named it the *eumillipes persephone*, the millipede, with
a whole one thousand three hundred and six legs, I suppose,
until one snags in a crevice between fingernail and flesh
or a trench, like the ones their legs rotted in.
Helmeted heads like hamsters in a game of whack-a-mole
peer up to the blue moon belonging to immortals and rabbits.
*Ground yourself,* the woman on screen exhales, *…out,*
The sand of my memory escapes between my fingers, yearning for each other
across a million years of evolution, stretched like phantom webbing.
*we are all human,*
until the world’s fair had boiled us all into soup:
feathers, femurs, and flesh alike
we were born without purpose, but we still write with intent.
*we all make mistakes.*
