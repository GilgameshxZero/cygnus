And so I flew, had flown,
on the wings you grew,
away.

Away,
away,
so far from my jealousy,
of you,
far from you,
so far,
for now.

There was just culture,
there was just revolution;
then there was everything,
then there was nothing.
So far, from afar, the swallow returns,
flying through the snowfall of Alaska,
on my seventeenth birthday.

It was winter, Ayame, and I respected you
so far, so much, I could only wish you well;
because you had been so kind to me,
attentive to my imagination,
of the apex up North,
I hated you, I hated you, I loved you, I hated you.
To be the best teammate, and not
a mediocre leader,
my talent was in cooking,
and yours in killing.

The curry is cold,
the stork swallowed the storm,
then there was nothing,
then there was everything.
