# Oh, witch, hair white,

princess of the black snow,
be my irradiant mute envy,
my original sin, abiogenesis.
Guide me with ghastly gloves
and squeeze from this heart
bloodied by the absence of sound,
a dejection, the seed of a new world,
the juice from the resolution of shrooms,
creativity, found only in the darkest of forests.
Show me that life is no more special than death,
alchemical truth, on this *orbis terrarum,*
a piano amidst decaying pipes and corrupted screens,
all within your eyes, your palm, the vat around a mind
of a goddess, my goddess, my creation.
I would kill them all for you.
