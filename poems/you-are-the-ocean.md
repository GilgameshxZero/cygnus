# You are the Ocean

Yang Yan
May 1, 2020

You are a deep glistening blue
stretching to the ends of the world,
while I am but a uncomfortably lonely brown
drowning in your inevitability.
You are a twisting, overwhelming white,
a whirlwind of organisms alike whom together direct the flow,
while I am but a dull, sheepish black,
scarred by the tides which always seem to push me away.
Oftentimes I peer to the warm golden sands,
and wonder if it would hurt me as you do.
Of course not.
You are the ocean,
and I am a fish,
and fish are meant to walk on land.
