# beauty in the classroom

August 29, 2021
❄

Mother always told me to keep an eyen mind.
My life would be much different from hers.
I would have opportunities she never had.

It’s true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the typical American classroom is full of beautiful things
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she would never had known.
They are painted in grand strokes of monochrome:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;posters of foreign metal bands beneath integration charts.
They are inscribed intricately into mahogany:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;undersides of desks covered rainbow by words with fuzzy meanings.
They are sung in the scorching sun of God and the country,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as airplanes to the city fly overhead to tunes they told me I had merely forgotten.

The American dream shines brightest between gritted teeth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which filter out the truth from the lies, the creativity from the structure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of learning in the classroom, and its inbred child of higher education.
Our professors, life devotees to the progression of society and its knowledge,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stand atop pyramids of pyrite, refined from 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the charcoal remains of a heart’s flames
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and appreciation letters from their followers, copy-pasted like assignments.

Beauty in the classroom splatters itself in stains of human grease and sharpie
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;onto pages throbbing only with words of perverse imitation.
Each duckling which crosses the street is uglier than its mother.
