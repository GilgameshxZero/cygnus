# Won't You Sleep With Me?

September 6, 2020

Across the high seas I would sail
where even the winds meet their end
over worlds of whales and dovetails
just to see you by the weekend.

Drowning all along the way in dreams
our lives that have only just begun
in our minds just seven nauts downstream
from a hometown we've since outrun.

My dear nameless hero, sleeping
underneath quilts of blue lapis
stitched by lustful sirens weeping
so please, won't you sleep with me?
