### apprentice of the apprentice

❄

Demon, demon, demon—demoncide?
No, DEMONDICE!
One, two, three, *hachi*,
I’m glad I grew wings,
burning sun on my back, hot wax on my ass.
*Iya!* I’m an M with sass!
*Tonto* the Indian’s been reborn, dumber than an idiot,
an artist.
Gone is the rap king, slaughtered is the rap god (Slim Shady, who’s that?)
The only god emperor I know, the grim reaper
she’s a white-haired half-elf with a fat fucking ass.

’cuz none of you know me, apprentice of the apprentice, apprentice of the grim reaper *onee-san*
One year, three years, seven years ago? Don’t care that it was all a dream
At least I’m here in hell, knowledge up my *tsuki* (fuck college),
ramen slow-cooking, *ch-chicken or beef, ch-chicken or beef?*
Hell yeah I’m glad I flew away that day.
