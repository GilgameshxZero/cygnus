# For the right price

‚ùÑ | June 6, 2021

Memories shape the mind
as scars do the body.
Who am I to reminisce
upon the five-petaled blossoms of a spring past
from a time only mine by hearsay?
Onto clattering chrome they cling,
a bedframe painted by fluttering whites,
a maiden draped in health anew.
I cry, but I do not know why.
A life is no cheap wish to grant,
but memories must be cheaper, right?
