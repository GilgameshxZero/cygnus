# Fuse

Yang Yan

Only since yesterday,
was my nose burning.
*Click, click,* of tired fingers and overworked clamps,
*Vroom, vroom,* from the motors overvolted and undervolted,
and that nervous chatter, *pscht, pscht*-ing through the night.
It is an odiferous barbecue chicken without the sauce,
the yelling and throwing and banging and blaming,
my hands on my face, blocking the blue light of death.

Only since the day before,
were my ears ringing.
*Tick, tick,* each as innocent as the last,
*drip, drip,* from both of our chins,
and that *sizzle* which never fizzles.
It is the blinding light at the end of a dark tunnel,
the harsh seventh-position on an E-string too high,
the rain of dust and debris which washes away nothing.

Only an eternity ago,
did my head not ache.
Only when my mind is clear,
do I remember that paperclips are not for clipping papers.
They are for unravelling, for probing,
for discovering the unknown.
From the bottom wall a face invites me,
so I stab its mouth and I stab its eyes.
Only for the fuse to say, "not today."
"Today, you owe me life."
