**Eutopia**

It used to be
that all that mattered was pen and paper and a single exam,
limitless,
so that I could blame not my birth nor my luck but only myself.

It used to be
that you were my only saving hope, my reason for charging ahead, ensign in hand,
bulletproof,
unwilling to die as I chased Guizi back across long-abandoned waters.

It used to be
that I would dream of flying from of the windows of my Foxconn residence,
fearless,
forgetful of the cost of a tombstone or of the land on which it dies.

I can't remember the last time I felt scared.
It tastes damp, wet, cold - this fear of mine -
it is the Tasteless, lurking in dark alleyways of bustling cities,
dashing between shadows, scrambling for any scraps you've left for me
after abandoning me.

"For you, the country, thus I turn my back,"
so the poet across the oceans croaks,
"there is a world elsewhere,"
a world which I fear I may never witness.
