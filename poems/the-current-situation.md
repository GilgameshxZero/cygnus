# The *Current* Situation

July 19, 2020
❄ ❄ ❄

You are the pattern of the
  silver moon upon the waves,
    the calendar dates marked
      in red, ripped off and crumpled,
        just another with whom I wished
      to share the stories of stars.

&nbsp;   You are the water of days of yore,
  a reminder of a Seaside full of
salt water taffy, our late night
  conversations, and all those hearts,
    those damned hearts, just like mine,
      confused. Can you just leave me be?
        To write is to suffer, and to suffer
      is to bargain, and all that, for just
    a teardrop of memories, of paprika
  and basil and peppercorn and cumin
and what might be the smell
  of your perfume.

&nbsp;   You are a signal oscillator.
      I met you first in college,
        a chapter, a test, a pandemic.
      I hate ships like the Titanic
    that take forever to sink.
  If I'm going to die, then
please just kill me already—
  though, I guess I don't mind
    looking like a french girl for a bit.
