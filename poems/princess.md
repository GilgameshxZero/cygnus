# Princess,

Would you hate me for dreaming of a mermaid?
Even as she screams as a lamb at the slaughter,
scales sharp as snowflakes, each belonging
to a prince of a land far, far away.

*…falling down, falling down, Columbia bridge, falling down.*

And so, lighter than air, we do.
Two bodies and not one whisper more.
A fairytale, a girl in a tower,
and love, the kind that floats, not falls,
amongst blue skies and puffy clouds.

Sing. sing… sing, —sing, *sing*
as does the mechanical songbird guarding a titanium cage, *sing*
as does its dear lamb, my daughter, prisoner of the floating city, *sing,*

*birds fly, and grasshoppers hop,*
*the least we can do is dream…*

---

Would you fly with me, princess?
