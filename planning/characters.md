> To dream—to despair—to perish—all at the hands of gods unwilling to show us an ounce of the respect we’ve shown them. We humans are no different—just as they bickered and fought with thundering might, we kill and are killed for reasons no grander than ourselves. 

## Eva

The long-lost love of the Sovereign, Eva comes from the race of seafarers, who reside below the ocean in technologically advanced submarines. They are the descendants of the seceding scientists from the era of the World-Dragon.

## Aria

A human girl in living in Year 374.

The first narrator, Aria is a quiet, thoughtful, and dreamy girl from Fonte. She serves as librarian in Fonte until an event pushes her to travel to capital city Erlija. Aria seeks a sense of purpose, a sense of belonging, and someone who can tell her the truth of why she was born or created.

## November

A human male living in Year 317.

The second major narrator, November hails from Felys, his Alverian name derived from a wristwatch before he knew the tongue well. Talented but impulsive, he joins the Commerce Guild on a miracle, and later, follows Rigel to establish the revolutionaries.

## Charlotte

A performer on the SS Halcyon, Charlotte is a part of the royal performing troupe as they tour across Alveria, recounting old folklore such as that of the World-Dragon. Energetic, animated, and emotional, Charlotte keeps Aria as a close friend of hers and pushes her to listen to her heart.

## Oscar

A focused piano player at the house across the Fonte Library. His dream is to become Alveria’s premiere piano performer, and works towards that goal endlessly.

## Rigel

As leader of the Commerce Guild, Rigel is tasked with maintaining the guild's relationship with the Alverian government. With trade at the center of the rising tensions with Felys, Rigel finds the guild the subject of increasing restrictions which cripple its ability to benefit its members. When Prince Altair declares the orphans illegal, Rigel abandons his post at the guild and instead recruits a band of revolutionaries to liberate the orphans.

## Prince Altair

The second prince of Alveria, Altair recognizes his advantaged position in claiming power from his weakening father. Prideful and strong, he will back down at nothing to ensure the best future and life for all Alverians. This, however, does not include the orphans.
