## Of Plains and Airships

Aboard the airship *Halcyon*, Aria travels alone over the golden plains of grain towards Alveria's capital city, Erlija. Perusing over the event catalog, Aria recognizes a familiar name on the cast of the show for the nightâ€”Charlotte. A close childhood friend from their hometown Fonte, they had not spoken since she left for Erlija to pursue a career in acting.

## The Day the Arcs Fell

The play tells the folklore of humanity's beginnings on Earth, then a planet covered in water. An ancient civilization, the old humans, escape from Old Earth aboard the Arc, a gigantic space-faring ship complete with an ecosystem and old humans from each of Old Earth's civilizations.

When the Arc's summers become too warm and its winters become too cold, the chief scientist, played by Charlotte, cautions the Arc director that the Arc may be nearing the end of its lifetime. Her overly pessimistic view of society leads to her team's exile from the arc with only a small airship and a handful of equipment.

The scientist and her team makes a living for themselves under ocean. When the Arc fails and its occupants are hastily evacuated, the scientists attempt to lend whatever aid they can, but are turned away, being blamed instead for the incident. Having lost everything, humanity starts from scratch in the oceans and the remains of the Arc.

Throughout the play, Charlotte narrates her impression of the transpiring events.

## Erlija Past

Aria joins Charlotte after the show, and they head to the secluded upper deck to cool off. Just as they begin to reminisce about the night that changed their childhood, an explosion reverberates through the *Halcyon*. Running their way down to the main deck, they recognize a familiar face: Nathaniel. Now a royal guard, he had been stationed on the *Halcyon* amidst internal suspicions of a terrorist attack. Nathaniel leads the girls to the evacuation blimps, but Aria is cut off by falling debris on the way there. Nathaniel tells her to stay put and wait for aid. When Nathaniel arrives at the evacuation blimps, he orders another guard to go back and get Aria.

The second guard finds Aria. She remarks that his eyes are cold like snow. When she jumps down to him, they crash through the remains of the burning airship. Free falling toward the plains, believing they are dead, they confess their darkest thoughts to each other. The guard reveals his name to be November, and Aria remarks that his eyes were cold like the snow, like a certain someone she had known in her childhood. November, the terrorist in disguise, suddenly realizes his stolen guard uniform comes with a parachute, and the two scramble to deploy it. Finally, Nathaniel spots them in the air, and the four reunite and travel the remainder of the way to Erlija aboard the blimp.

## Six Feet Underwater

One night in Fonte, Aria gets into an argument with her parents. She questions her parents' treatment of her, and their favoritism of her brother.

After finding out she is adopted, Aria storms out of the house. She arrives at the creek, where she encounters November amidst a suicide attempt, where they discuss their thoughts on upbringing, identity, and purpose. November brings up Aria's snowglobe necklace, and Aria remarks on November's name and eyes. November jumps into the river anyway, but survives.

Nathaniel and Charlotte join them shortly after.

## The Prince and the Mermaid

A prince abandons his princess to fall in love with a mermaid. When she abandons him, he creates endless synthetic humans in search of her likeness. The factory lights up the world-dragon's horn and forms the north star.

## La Vita Nuova

November sneaks off to the neighboring town, and takes the entrance exam to the Magus Guild.

In the Magus Guild, November meets Rigel, and the two of them begin planning terrorist plots to steal top-secret documents from the Alveria government. This eventually leads to the bombing of the *Halcyon*, with November infiltrating as a guard, and Rigel providing updates from Erlija.

## Bottomless Like Mimosas

Returning from November's vigil, Aria, Charlotte, and Nathaniel experience a night of unexpected event after unexpected event, Aria finds herself following the phantom of November until she is led to loneliness. There, she realizes that she must go meet her maker in the Sovereignty.
The Magus Guild, recognizing her from November's descriptions, allows her aboard the Avalon with Rigel and other revolutionaries as they head toward Blackfeather.
