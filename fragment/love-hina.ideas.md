Outline:

* Debating whether to go to office hours.
* Going to OH for the first timeâ€”meet Hina, who's different from Helen, Grace, Cat.
* Ask for help on optimizing quad-tree construction for project 2.
* I'm working alone because I didn't get along with my project partner.
* Hina invites me to her dorm room to work on the project together on Friday night.
* Time skip to Friday night, after dinner, we have some snacks, I manage to construct the quad-tree, splitting lines into groups is hard.
* With her help, I manage quad-tree modification to get under 2s. I get my reward.
* Make-out, no more quad-trees are constructed. It is snowing outside.
