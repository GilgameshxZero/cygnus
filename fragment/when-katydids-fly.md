*Why not be free?*

So had he asked, "why not be free?" And, really, why not? Why not thrust the windows open and set our souls free to roam among the *plitter, platter* of the lonely night rain? Why not run, run, *run,* down, out, and far, far away from the light which illuminates the sky, far away from the bricks and mortar of those who live by the sun and die by the moon? Why not scream, why not yell to our heart's content against all the regret and suffering, all the inequality and privilege which the world so nonchalantly assigns with a roll of the dice?

Why not?

And so I ask myself once again amidst the waves purple as the setting sun. But no longer will my answer matter anymore. I had given my final answer when I boarded the *Avalon*. Across the water lies but one destination. "Nature's grave," Charlotte had named it then, dreamily, "where all the currents of both water and wind go to breathe their final breath." The proud tale of those who had been lucky enough to escape the pull of the currents, Blackfeather was the child of a blizzard which never slept and a night which never lifted.

I find little comfort in the thought of never being able to return to daylight. As I peer into the silent world of my snow globe, I wonder if it was the right decision after all. Had I even chosen this for myself, or had I been but a ship swept along by the currents of my creation? Frantically, I look for his arms—someone's arms—in which to bury my head and my doubts. But all that I find are the waves which crash against the small circular window at the foot of my bed. Now, I am alone.

And so I write. I write to stave off my ever-growing loneliness. I write, because as well prepared as the *Avalon* is for this two-week journey, I have with me nothing but my journal and a pen. And, of course, his letter. It sits on the corner of the bedstand, a flimsy two pages, one sandwiched within another, folded down the middle, width-wise. "For Aria," the outer page reads. I promise myself to save what few words must reside within for when I truly feel helpless. And in a struggle to feel at ease, I put pen to journal and close my eyes, drowning out my senses and my loneliness with only the sound of the waves.

The waves—they crash and then recede, *crash then recede.* They swallow everything, a big blue mouth lined with white as it eats away each little ship which bobs on its stomach. I shudder, fearing the darkness inside its mouth. Into the darkness I extend my grasp, searching for any memory to give me warmth, anyone who would understand me. *Shhh,* the mother of the night sea whispers, quietly washing away my adulthood, whisking me away to the time when I had first felt her gentle embrace so many years ago.

It was too loud.

Huddled behind an overgrown bush, we peered between blades of wild grass like four wide-eyed cats at midnight. When the flashlights darted over to the territory we had claimed as ours, we slammed our eyes shut, fearing that their reflections would give away any sign of our presence.

Nathaniel had his mouth open wide, desperately trying to catch his breath without making a sound. Charlotte was crying silently. I wiped the snot and dirt from my lips onto my sleeve and turned my head to look at him. He was shuddering like a lost cat who had run off after a bath before being dried. He was wet, *really* wet, *dripping-water-from-head-to-toe* wet. Tapping Charlotte on her shoulder, he pointed to the towel she had been using to wipe her tears. She looked up with that expression of hers, a mix between relief and some other warm feeling, and hugged him so tightly I might have believed it if she had managed to squeeze his clothes dry. But we ended up with two wet cats instead.

And suddenly, it stopped. There were no more blaring sirens. No more lights which shone red and blue and red and blue. I heard a man's voice, a car's engine, and finally, silence. Silence, except for the ever-present trickling of the water of the river nearby. It hopped and jumped over rocks and sticks, crash landing back into the dark waters each time. For a moment, as I stared to the stars, I thought, *why am I here?*

*Why was I there?*

It is difficult for me to imagine fitting in with any other group of friends back then. Whether it be a result of my isolated upbringing or one of those things that the god of this world had decreed at its creation, I had found them always but two steps away. I miss them. Without Nathaniel, I wouldn't even have been able to pass the port checkpoint, much less even have a ship to cross the high seas. Charlotte's meal preparation had come along with me in the *Avalon* too, and a whole three-weeks worth at that. I told her it was too much, that even two weeks was an over-estimate. But she had looked at me with that playfully grumpy look, peering out from the side of the all the food she was carrying on her lap. I didn't have the heart to tell her no and watch her inevitably tear up again. I doubt anyone would have been able to refuse.

And him? All he had left with me was that little note. He never wrote much anyway. It must mean a lot, coming from him, he who was always an advocate for ideas. "Things crumble and decay away, just like people," he had proclaimed proudly, "but ideas last forever." I had asked him what would happen to an idea when the person carrying it passes away.

"The idea passes on to the people who care about them," he answered, as matter-of-fact as could be.

It was in this same straightforward tone that he had answered my very first question so long ago. I suppose he was right in that I never forgot that first answer, the first idea he had brought up. But then again, I can hardly forget enough of the past.

"November, like the month."

"That's stupid," I replied.

"You're stupid," he ejected, "what's your name, huh?"

"Aria. My parents say it's Italian for air."

"So you're like the air, like nothing? That's pretty stupid."

I must have stormed off then, as I fail to recall the rest of the conversation. At some point, I must have complained about him to the teacher, because all I do remember is him coming back to apologize some time later.

"Sorry," he mumbled in probably the most insincere apology I can ever recall, "you're name's not stupid. It's Aria." Looking back, the way he fidgeted as he said that was pretty cute.
