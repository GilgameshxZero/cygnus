"I, too, had wished to meet him."

"Aria, I—I never thought we were much different. When I first met you, I thought I had found someone who finally understood me. And so I followed you, and I came to learn of your goals and your aspirations. But look where that's taken us."

"You and I—we're worlds apart. But even so, I couldn't stay away from you. I don't know anymore—was it you, or was it your dream? Eventually, I came to believe in what you had always believed as well. I thought I could be just like you."

"But you're different. You're special. You see, Aria, I know something about you even you don't know. See this?"

And in his hands rest an orb, glistening with light from the ceiling lamp above.

"You deserve more than anyone else to meet the Sovereign. After all, you're a child of the snow. And you're the one I loved."

*Winter comes like a dream. Magic was a product of the era of gods, but humanity has come to wield what remains of it. In the search for purpose, there was but one person who could give me what I desired. Hidden away in the snowy frontier of Starfall, the Sovereign's mystery had brought its first death, but also my only hope.*
