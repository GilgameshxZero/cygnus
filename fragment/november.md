This... it was a gift from her. When the sun shone down and there was not a speck in the sky, I would peer into this world and think of her. Then, I was still young. I argued with my parents almost every day. I ran out at nights, and refused to listen to my teachers. It made no sense to me. When I ran out that night, I met her. She was different, just like me. I think—maybe she was having a hard time living as well. The snow was a refuge for us, letting us hide in that moment in the morning which seemed to last forever.

You and I—we were never fighting against each other. There's no one in this world who doesn't wish to make it better. But the way that people go about it—that's what causes all this strife and suffering. But I trust you—you must have a purpose for doing all this, working so hard to come here, to confront me. So go on. I won't stop you. Rather, when you next encounter someone who does, remember this—no one is your enemy. A creator fights only against himself.

Remember what you told me so many years ago, Aria? That fairytales were fairytales, and would never come true. Well, I never stopped believing. I know they're real. And even though I can no longer see them, I know you will be able to.
