And it was down. Down, down the *trash chute* we fell, of nuts and bolts and dead girls diced, down through the clanging of an E-minor arpeggio, through cuts, through bruises—yet still, you held me, so gentle, so fragile, like glass in a lamb’s womb; so, thus, we fell. And the snow would ring from beyond the pipes; I could hear it, you see; I could see it through the metal. It thudded as it landed, melting into a quilt. We were going to crash, I knew, we were going to melt. And if I had known just a bit more, I would know that I was scared.
