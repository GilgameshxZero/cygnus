No—it is not the passing of Rigel which spurs my actions. Rather, it is but the final act in a play already begun, the journey upstream in the same rapids travelled a lifetime ago, the returning of the catalyst after a chemical reaction. None could have altered this outcome.

When you learn of my bloated corpse adrift in the river at Fonte, you will inevitably ask: *why?* And, indeed, I could answer you as such: that no worthy play ends without finality, that each salmon must maintain the cycle of reproduction, that a chemical not restored is no catalyst—and, for me, that a promise made must be kept. And you would continue with *what*. What promise? What promise was worth your life?

So. Today I write not to enlighten you about me, but instead to show you the world, as I have seen it. And once you see, I think, you’ll *see*.

When I joined the guild fifteen years ago, Jean was the first to greet me. He beamed, and he chuckled, and naive as I was, I bowed, and I nodded. That was the Felysian way. I could not grasp the Alverian tongue until years later. Before then, they communciated with me in script—Christina’s letters were the most beautiful amongst them all, and it had attracted me to her before we had spoken a single word to each other. Jean never wrote to me. I would write to him, and he would read just as the others did. But no sooner had he read my note, he would laugh, and he would speak, foreign words tapping like raindrops on my bedroom window. But years later, when it finally opened, I felt not the warm rain of summer upon my forearm; rather, alongside the winter winds flew in a storm and all its pellets of ice—to think, all that, in just a sentence, a greeting!

“Don’t you worry—people like you? Born filthy, die filthy. Enjoy your stay on the scenic route.”

All these years, I’ve held his words close. So harsh! So hostile! At the time, I didn’t believe it. Each time I had argued with father, he had always ended it by telling me, in that deep, serious tone of his, that same idiom in Felysian: “the apple never falls far from its tree.” But I was no apple, he was no tree, and Jean no wise sage. I could fly to wherever I wished. After all, it was my life to live—my play to write, my waters to swim, my reaction to conduct.
