Back then, I had believed that our time together would last forever.

How out of touch was a man to believe in *forever*? *Nothing is forever,* she would respond, *because nothing is perfect—not them, not you, and definitely not me.* But to me, she *was* perfect.

Last night, I dreamt the same dream: of her, seemingly dancing amongst the cherry blossoms. She stared curiously at me as I lay on the ground—inquisitive—with those reflective brown eyes of hers—a glistening, crystallized world of sand. But she wasn't lifeless like the desert. No. She was the ocean. She was the sound of waves, crashing again and again onto the shore on which I lay, as they carried her further and further away from my paralyzed body.

Only the waves are left to keep me company. I command the tireless *Avalon* north in search of the manifestation of its namesake.
