In the Erlijan winds is truth, fallen from the stars in a downpour, on a day long ago—and as time held its breath in the ripples upon fresh puddles, the clock towers tolled—for a past lost to regret, for a future lost to inevitability—and so had he prayed: *upon these feathers tarred, in a white winter evermore,* for a fairytale: of redemption, for the blackbird from Felysia; of an end to the war, three decades overripe. This is a tale that began when the dreamer awoke, a tale whose ending had long since been known, but had yet to be written. This is a story told by those who remained behind, when everything else had gone.

I was born the wind-chroniclers, in the town where waters originated. We called it *Fonte*—a word from the gods from before our time. They say we all descended from the gods, before they tired of us and retreated into the oceans—hence why the oceans always hold the most sacred of vows.
