The opening scene, set amidst a burning airship, where Aria is re-united with childhood friend November.
Core ideas:

* Color injection—the world and voice is monochromatic and bland until they see each other again. The only color in their narratives are reserved for each other.
* Central (rising) narrative—Aria leads the normal, central narrative which amounts to the bombing of the airship. In present tense.
* Secondary (falling) narrative—November leads a second voice, in past tense, as he reflects upon the night Aria saved him.
* Rising tensions—the world is falling apart, just like the airship, but Aria and November can find comfort in each other.
* Motif-in-the-middle—the big event happens at about halfway in the narrative. For Aria, this is the beginning of the explosions; for November, this is when he breaks free and runs toward his test. This motif also shifts the world into color.
* Foreshadowing—Charlotte's play, *The Day the Arcs Fell*, strongly foreshadows the burning of the Halcyon.

Notes:

* Separate narratives should be extremely clear from the get-go.
* Similarly, that November's narrative goes back in time should be clear as well.
* Focus on worldbuilding—the characters' aspirations and concerns stem from the world around them. November attempts the bombing due to the political and social pressures surrounding his faction. Aria is stunted and scared due to the same pressures.
* November and Aria are only partially defined by their relationship with each other, but primarily with the world around them.
* Charlotte and Nathaniel play an important role in giving Aria and November a way to interact with the world outside of their bubble with each other.
