“You won’t stop me?”

“Did the folks below give you trouble? Don’t blame them for it—they never knew your father, Lyra.”

“And you did? Who were you to him, anyway?”

“He was already old, so old, when you came to us—_born from a dream_, he stumbled out that morning, _my debt is repaid at last._ The Sovereignty was cracking at its seams: a nest for the revolution, frozen at the edge of the world, and he no longer cared. He holed up in his lab and forbade us from ever entering, leaving the world in our hands. We had hardly succeeded in fighting for our independence, and knew nothing of the administration of a city. But the people followed us regardless, and so we were to try.”

So he sighed, pacing under a soft haze emanating from the window. It was winter, and it was snowing, as it always was, blanketing the sky in clouds colored in a fading pastel. The shape of the tower was obvious now, as glass walls slanted and converged toward the ceiling. I must be close to the top.

Beneath us, the city sprawled, its million oppressed souls shining into the night. They had called on me, and so it had become my duty: to reclaim the throne from the usurpers, to bring my father back to his senses, to rekindle the halcyon of the Sovereignty. For months we had planned, and waited, taking control of the harbors and prisons and waterways, all for this moment. I was not to fail.

Whoever waited for me atop Starfall Tower, I was to convince them of our mission, or depose of them.

“Where is he? Where is my father?” I narrowed my gaze toward the ceiling, a mahogany, opaque in an otherwise transparent space. The man across from me noticed, and brew a slight smirk, skin creasing upon itself in a gaunt, tired face.

“You are right, of course. The day he left his lab—yes, above us—he took you with him, descending down the same way you came, never to return. This was some twenty-odd years ago. I haven’t been up there since, and frankly, was hoping you’d know where your father went, or at least knew how to access the lab.”

Approaching the center of the room, I look up to find a camera. It scanned my eyes for some form of biometrics, and I felt a tug against the metal in my body. When it finished, a spiral staircase descended from the ceiling above, circling around me. I shot a glance toward the gaunt man, and he nodded back, as if saying _go ahead, I’ll be waiting here when you’re done._ And so up I went, step after step, finding myself in a room fully illuminated by the skylight. This must be my father’s lab.

Across from the bed, in the opposite end of the circular room, was a plain writing desk; upon it, papers, a rare sight in the Sovereignty of today, but no pen in sight. I picked up the few pages and read.

> gilgamesh *test*

Dear Lyra,

In the Old World, long before our time, there was a king Gilgamesh who ruled in tyranny… And upon his seventh day, he gained that clarity one recognizes on the brink of death, and wrote the above. Of this, Utnapishtim obeyed, and inscribed upon a tablet—between the tenth and the eleventh, only recently to be recovered. Thus, I wrote.

I too recognized, just days prior, the looming shadow of death upon my soul.

And so we were away in arpeggio, sliding down the underbelly of this city, through dead girls diced and served in parsley…

> coriolanus

I aspired to write like the poet, yet before I knew it, his characters had captured my heart… That which Matrius felt for Rome was love, a different kind.

And so I write of love, yet still I am unable to triangulate the love a father has for his daughter.

The Sovereignty shall fall, and you cannot stop it…

And so, I write to you, my greatest creation, now and forever… From the day I built you, of nuts and bolts, of brains and all that… Yet, in the end, I have left you with nothing: no kingdom, no inheritance, no family… For a princess, this is death I’m sure, and so for this, I am sorry… I am surely a terrible father, though please understand, it is not for a lack of trying.

Automatons are built with directives, but humans are born without purpose. In this way, you are free… and it is this freedom that which I could never obtain. …Because you were already special, and the greatest blessing I could give you was the life of a normal girl.
