No caring human would ever put a cat in a box. But, imagine, for a second, that, like the great scientists of old, you did so. And with it, a small pressurized can of poison gas, set to release when an isolated alpha particle decayed. Without opening the box, there would be no way to tell if the cat were still alive. One could say that it was simultaneously dead and aliveâ€”though, of course, this would chance upon your observation.

And perhaps if you had multiple cats, you would find that most of the cats would die when you opened their box after a while. But let's say that one day, all the cats began dying. All the alpha particles had decayed. If you had a million cats, could you decay a million alpha particles?

Probability turns to determinism. What was uncontrollable suddenly is within reach. Yet, chaos and order still lay but two steps away. But two steps is enough for the creator.
