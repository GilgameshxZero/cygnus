Great lyrical piece, good imagery. Loved letter format. Liked the use of “you”. Not clear at first it was a letter. Why is there not a “dear” at the beginning. Wasn’t clear who the letter was for until the beach scene.

A lot about the relationship with the mother, but not enough about the relationship with the father. What did the father do? What was his job? Did he protect the son?

Confused about era of this piece—very historical from the beginning. Kindergarten, trains, etc. place it modern—vs. taking a train, bus, etc. to a beach. Modes of transporation and tech are confusing. Which time period is this? A mix of old and new.

Beautiful wrting, website vibe. IRL cultural elements with fantasy is hard to do, but really great. What time period is confusing, but know what to talk about :) Didn’t feel like the ambiguity confused her.

Liked the distance the fantasy element introduced about the immigration experience. Liked the voice. Distance from culture, loss. Loved the girlfriend element! Liked the island devils! Closer to 1980s than 2010s. Liked that part!

“Looking back, I had only wanted one thing from you.” Wasn’t clear that this love was what the narrator was looking for in the beginning.

Liked the website vibe. Capture immigrant tension, like yellow wallpaper reference (funny).

Brings expectations of fantastical things happening, since it is placed in a fantasy element. Want to move to real-world setting? Wasn’t given too much about the world, or whether there was magic or the politics.

More emotional resonance and tension with dialogue, real-time events, zoom in, emotional core of the piece, it’s too distance. Too distant. Too temporally distant. Too past. Narrative distance. Given via narration. Given via letter.

Often in a letter it’s summary. In literature, they are no so much telling, much more dialogue. More showing.
