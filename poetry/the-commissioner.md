# The Commissioner

(TW: Gore.)

*A picture*, he said.

I don't have pictures
of myself
because I don't like seeing myself.
Always:
too short, too scarred, too fat, too tired, too greasy,
and the angle,
never right,
and the lighting on my face,
never smooth (never like the lighting on her face as she deliberates whether or not to dance with a stranger much kinder than her husband in a film from 1953).
What is a picture without a face?

Oh right,
it doesn't have to be a picture of myself.

The only pictures I have
are those drawn of anime girls in beautiful landscapes.
If I looked like that,
I'd have more pictures of myself.
If I had someone like that,
I'd have more pictures of her.
But they say you can't have people,
so all I have are my imagination
and these drawings.

But who are *they*, really?
Really,
no one
to Jeffrey Epstein, to Prince Andrew.
Why is it that we know the names of the commissioners better than the names of the models?
I only care about the girls!
Why can't I commission my own painting?
The price of a life is $50,000-$100,000 when taken (depending on the difficulty of obtaining transportation to their country of residence prior to assassination).
So for just a painting,
it must be even less

right?



Ah.



~my

—brilliant!

<div class="align-right">



a PIKE!
from anus to mouth
(her dream was to be a poledancer, or as she called it, "pole fitness instructor")

<div class="script">

an expression of her desire
for freedom

</div>

</div>

9 times ~submerged~
in ice cold
71 minutes total!
(but how do you draw a frozen anus,
only 26.5° at death,
only 1.3° lower than at final submersion?)

<div class="script">

she is finally liberated

</div>

<div class="align-right">

or her cute little
homeless and undocumented face
after 10mg
of bleach
in her pregnant uterus
three hours ago
and now
masses of blood and hair falling out
(the undocumented ones are the sluttiest)

<div class="script">

the price for freedom

</div>

</div>





i hate myself
my body
my skin
my face
i want to burn it all off

to become the artist
to date the commissioner
to fuck the model
