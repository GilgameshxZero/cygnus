The saddest thing in this life of ours is our own past.

We live forever, shadowed in the remains of our memories.
Dawn, when the sun peeks through the mist in the hills, dispelling,
reminding us of all we had forgotten from the night past.
We drink our livelihoods away, sipping on waves of the Pacific, where
explorers once looked to the stars, searching for a future,
past the oceans, at the end of the world.
Just off its eastern coast, in our little corner of the universe, you’ll smell
the dew upon the leaves in parks littered with signs that read
“NO CAMPING BETWEEN 10PM AND 6AM”;
you’ll smell the marijuana and urine and you’ll hear the voices,
sharp, overlapping, but muffled,
through the double-layered aluminum walls of trailers,
long having forgotten the purpose of their wheels,
the reason behind their names.
Turn right at the river, where stacks of styrofoam to-go boxes and plastic cups
have organized their own little waterfall, and you’ll find my past;
you’ll find my bridge, my photo, and you’ll find me, now.
I need that me to understand this: it was never your fault.
