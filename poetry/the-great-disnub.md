*All* these immigrants, the cranes
and the pheasants and magpies,
the firebacks down south,
their culture a currency, the wind an exchange,
calls and puts and stop loss cheats
flight given only by mating songs and chirping tweets.
“I just want to eat good music, and make good ramen,”
says the tiny bird who flies over multicolored worlds of low and high,
wings a great mix of yellow and blue and green and red,
under skies undiscernable between light and a painter misled;
mix them all together, is it black or white which flies above my head?

It is:
a crock pot of nations and a fever dream too,
I can’t say *fuck* (them) but I can instead do,
from bamboo-binded Chopin and origami fighter jets
to polar coordinate origins filled with quadratic residue.
Who cares that every even number is the sum of two primes,
when the real part of the zeta function is all on two lines,
when the lines were drawn by a white man and the wings spread by a white girl,
and the crane who cries wolf at the ceiling tramples me with a qipao twirl?

Look at all that:
Tan and Kingston and polynomial disputes over cultural roots?
Yeah, I’m here, I flew away; why? The girls at Pratt are extra cute!
