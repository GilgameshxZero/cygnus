# Haha, *Call Me Maybe*, Get It?

On the second day of winter, you called me, a man of winter, as I like to call myself. The night before, I had called out to you, but it was his call I heard back. "You should've paid more attention to the *littlest things*," he chuckled, as I called for you, "see? You still have unanswered calls." But the options are yours; for me, they are not so optional. I don't even know his name. I don't know the names of prying eyes as I run, face to the melting asphalt, sweaty and exposed to the screams of playing children. But I hate them, just as much as I hate that you still laugh at my dumbest jokes, that I find it endearing that you would still call me from the middle of nowhere with no signal, that I would still answer "yes". If you called.
