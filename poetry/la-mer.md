# la mer

‚ùÑ

a wind, a whisper
a whimper, a wish
from centuries past to the dragoness
guardian of freedom evermore

a washing away, wailing water
a cleansing of dawn's daughter
her gaze cast over seven continents
weeping now for the goddess's light

a solitude, a storm
a spire, a snowfall
oh, dear, saturnine child of forsaken times
in ice, cast me, into hereafter
lest be our chronicle's end, ultramarine
