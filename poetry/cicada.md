*Tchchchchchchch.*
Flannel around waist.
Bright, freckled skin burning under the sun.
Sweaty pins and needles prick the inside of my clogged pores.
I scratch and scratch and scratch but there are no whiteheads nor blackheads, only redheads, like her—their
juice dripping down my cheeks.

It was so bright. Bright like
—the glare in her eyes, a wet brown desert with a black hole, a reflection of
—the neapolitan, a compromise of flavors, of her name, Nea for short like
—$\pi r^2h/3$ where $h$ was short for height, the height from it to the ground which was so far, further than the *tchchch*-ing of
—the birds and the trees brown like the devil's eyes and the snake whose shells of
—life and rebirth and eggs and blood and—

*splat* on the ground but only the strawberry's blood, my blood Nea's blood and never the vanilla man's blood who stands behind me with his *tchchchch* nor the chocolate man's blood who squeezes life from the cylinder in his hands but the *tchchch* *TCHCHCH* comes and comes and comes and never stops and lays their eggs in my cookie dough to turn me into a strawberry and juices me dry to be the queen of a new

dynasty.
