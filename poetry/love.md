The north star.
It was us.
You said.
Daddy and me.
You loved me.
All things
in this world
fall down.
You said.
You showed me
ma-cheen dust,
saw-meal water.
You showed me
the star-do
which you
made me from.
We went down
dressed in dirt
to see dirt.
Two worms
together
to make one more.
You said.
But you loved me
more than two.
Three!
Or just one…
You wouldn’t
give me away
to anyone else.
They didn’t
get you
but I did
daddy
I loved you.
I love you.
Don’t worry
daddy
I will tell them
“go away!”
Daddy is busy
already
for many years.
So when you
aren’t busy
can I
see you again?
