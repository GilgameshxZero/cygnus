<h1 id="see-it-wasnt-always-like-this">See, It Wasn’t Always Like This</h1>
<p>November 29, 2021<br>
❄</p>
<p>See, it wasn’t always like this.<br>
The enforcer of consistency, the mellow of stigma:<br>
thusly,<br>
at the end of it all, a splaying of light, splattering onto the walls<br>
like blood out of a clot, the remaining neural impulses of<br>
this mind’s last thought. “I am a scientist,” I proudly exclaimed,<br>
a white rat of truth where home equals firehose. Raytrace and retrace<br>
my duty to the past, with haste, I echo into the chamber: the secret is just a means<br>
for a question to ask its next.</p>
<p>So inside the fiber-optic I skip along the light, knowing full well<br>
the worth of a scientist is his nose, as well as his plight. The deeper we descend,<br>
the further light disperses, but our intuition tells us nonetheless<br>
a story of beauty. For there is little reason to believe<br>
that all these rays of present are the result of one bang, one burst,<br>
except in this nose of ours: a rich aroma of fragmented snow,<br>
each flake a glass shard, broken by a web of lies, and tied back by the string of causality,<br>
the only thing which can live forever: a shattering of the snowglobe of the past,<br>
and a memory with it.</p>
<p>See, it wasn’t always like this.<br>
Beneath the scar’s pink is a human’s yellow.<br>
Before there was the scientific method, there was folklore<br>
of the first-generation immigrant, flying all the way across the Pacific,<br>
taking American jobs, stealing American research,<br>
just three years old, knowing not a word of American;<br>
of the great revolution, a fight for representation, a mother of only taxation,<br>
for three days in mid-December, a tea party,<br>
for all men who were created equal.<br>
Before there was folklore, there were memories,<br>
memories of leather so fake it wouldn’t even smell if it was burnt,<br>
and the parents who would bring lighters to clothes stores;<br>
memories of the oppressed who came down from his mansion,<br>
to toss a king-size mattress, barely slept,<br>
and the model minority in the dumpster, dreaming yet again for their son<br>
asleep on hand-wiped hardwood;<br>
stories of the forbidden word, and all the stigma around it,<br>
each memory a ray of light from this forsaken snowglobe.<br>
See, it wasn’t always like this.</p>
<p>So when someone was stabbed at Times Sq. last Saturday,<br>
I said that I wished that were me, doing the stabbing.<br>
Where I come from, human lives are worth less than those of ants.<br>
So when a beggar at Penn asked me for $3 for food,<br>
I spat in his hand, and he spat back, before we both shook hands.<br>
Where I come from, all humans are created equal, equally worthless.<br>
So when they stopped me at the voting booth,<br>
and told me I was Chinese, I only asked for tea,<br>
and they wouldn’t give me even a single leaf.<br>
So when I left my dream school, two weeks before graduating, I had to ask, “why?”<br>
So when weeks would pass in a day, and days would pass in a blink, I had to ask, “why?”<br>
So when the weight of the spoon reminded me of a knife’s scar on my hand, I had to ask, of course,<br>
“why?”</p>
<p>Because as a scientist, that is my duty.<br>
To retrace the steps of the past, the light which once was,<br>
from inside the tunnels of the firehose, from beyond the shattering of one’s memory,<br>
purposeful or not, without recognition:<br>
when questions land on our plate, we must eat them.<br>
So when I cried to my mother about my suicide attempt nine years ago,<br>
she said she wouldn’t have done anything differently; so, I kindly asked<br>
her to kill herself.<br>
But that would be too easy of a punishment,<br>
for someone who dreamt for their son,<br>
and scarred him for it too.</p>
<p>See, it wasn’t always like this.<br>
People who committed suicide actually wanted to die.<br>
Not just be reborn, not because they couldn’t find another way out.<br>
See, it wasn’t always like this,<br>
that this word was so stigmatized,<br>
hushed at every corner, redacted at every turn.<br>
See, it wasn’t always like this,<br>
that I had just one dream,<br>
and a negative number of lives,<br>
that the blood of my creation has been all bled out, nine years past,<br>
and all that remains is only what is wholly inhuman: a life for a dream,<br>
the dream of dreaming, for a life to be returned<br>
to someone who actually deserves it.</p>
<p>It’s a red tide, this life of ours.<br>
Surf on the wave, or drown in the sea of insignificance.<br>
See, it was always like this.<br>
Humanity has had but one dream for all of history,<br>
from Gilgamesh and Enkidu, to you and me.<br>
It is shaped like an hourglass of bodies, with each human standing<br>
atop a mountain of failed flesh and bones and scales and feathers.<br>
I don’t mind tossing myself into the pile, seeing where I end up.<br>
But I really do wonder what the world above is like.</p>
<p>See, it wasn’t always like this.<br>
At least, not until you showed up,<br>
with your golden missive,<br>
across the northern sunset.</p>
