Time bleeds through coffee filters:
polymorphed droplets of morning dew,
but the credence of a forgotten-dawn brew.
Within the spotted albedo silhouette of summer nights
the moon princess weeps from her cradle of fresh-cut bamboo.
Her tears tell stories of societies past, of every person who has dared
to glare at the sun
and found him much too bright.

The human body is 70% water.
I can’t help but hear her cries reverberate through my bones.
The human body is 70% water.
My muse calls for me through coffee grounds left over
from the flowing of time through the body,
my femur her G string, my spine her D string,
my skull

the café at the end of the world,
where time has all but halted.
Welcome to Café Melotea
serving customers at the end of the world
since 20xx.

Perhaps, another…
: another sip,
: another day,
: another night,
: another gallon of water which flows from the spring of youth,
straight off the edge of this world, into the mouths of turtles below,
will do.

The butterfly emerges to the taste of morning dew.
I must fulfill my dream.
