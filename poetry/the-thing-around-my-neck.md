# The Thing Around My Neck

Function—
where time slows itself amongst the spring petals,
suspended in disbelief, a viscous clarity, a freezing perversion,
where even physali and gerbera meet their maker.
And, for such, too, do I pray, world orb in hand,
rattling from its industrial chain links,
an inhospitable world, the only one I know.

It is a world
that I would tuck under my collar, the subtlest bump
raising eyebrows amongst all at the orphanage
for fear I was one of the loved, the *created,*
the different, unlike them:
one night, one mistake, and nine months of regret.

Forme—
I do not know my maker.
I do not know why she made me.
But I'm sure that it wasn't easy,
amidst the blizzard,
in a world not unlike my own,
with nuts and bolts and brains
and all that.
