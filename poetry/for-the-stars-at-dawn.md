# For the Stars at Dawn

May 24, 2020

For a star will never play on a broken drumset,
for a carved branch will never grow again,
for the end of a life is but a traffic light away,
and the end of a dream even closer.

For your final bet with the divine,
you raced towards the light and asked,
wheels for travel or wings for flight?
But the heart is brittle and the body even more,
for all stars fade when the dreamer awakens.
