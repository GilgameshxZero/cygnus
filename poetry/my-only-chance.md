# My Only Chance

August 9, 2020
❄

homeless, no
metropolis without a home
blaring and clinking and laughing
lights sharp like daggers
me and strange men—and
you
blinding
motorcycle

red, yellow, purple, neon
all blurs together
then, music, like iceland, like
a flooded jungle, drowning
I let go,
take me away

*you are my key,*

---

gun in hand
orchestra in other
and bach and beethoven in between
I'm sure we heard the same organs that day
but you, other hand on bible
prayed

why hadn't I?

my actions will have consequences
.

---

*my only chance*

test after test
failure after failure
higher
and
higher
suffocating desperation
I
grab on and
never
let go

kill you, and
I'll
be

*free*
