# Dragons and Kingdoms

August 2, 2020

i remember now

Air humid with the perfume of the banyans,
and people, like oceans, like canyons.
A hometown, a country, a day from our shanty to the town gates,
where tutor Felys taught us all about the cities and the states.

and the expeditions over seas and kingdoms
and the dragons that would breathe fire and bless kings
oh! how I wish I could be a king

But there are no kings in this nation,
only presidents and prime ministers and chairmen,
experienced and adept in the magic of rules and litigation,
the dragon's weakness.

so I blink and dream of losing another twenty-one years
that this flesh may turn to dust again,
and I blink again until
my father swims aboard from the waters of middle earth,
a puddle for the boot which loved the new life but not lives which needed to begin anew
and I blink again until
my mother rides her parasol like Mary Poppins
up and up until she flies away again, a butterfly unchained by love, whose fluttering my father must have heard from across the high seas
and I blink again until
bullets are shot from the heads of God-hating heretics,
mines are removed from the dirt and trenches re-filled,
forest fires breathe carbon and exhale oxygen,
all the banyan trees grow their roots together, a world-tree,
with me but an erg on the Yggdrasil, a space-farer from a distant humanity
travelling the universe on an Arc greater than eight billion people put together
powered by the sun, my greatest invention, as I say to it

"creations can never surpass their creator"
