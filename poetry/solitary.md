# Solitary

*I float amongst the waves' desire.*

*Every disturbance in the ether carves itself upon my fate,*
*the winds, a tornado, and I, a flurry, high and low, a ship, a speck amidst deep blue.*

*Deep, dark, blue. Almost, like, …*

Desireless. Shameful. One in a million, and it was this sea that you chose.
A brush through the window paints light upon the waters of our shared canvas.
Do you not witness His miracle?

Perhaps, like me, you are blind.
Perhaps, like me, you are but the lapis lazuli whose shadow has dashed itself upon the curtain of a puppet show—blue, but I cannot see color.

…dance, then.
Like the frenzied acolytes of Dionysus, like the bloodlet goat bleating its last ambition,
dance with me, dust to dust, body to dust, in God's light, and rejoice!
Rise up with your brethren, discarded fools of a once-beautiful gem,
the pride of humiliation, the dirt of solitary.
Chip and break away at the dream of a dream, the illusion of hope, the crack upon my *perfect blue*.

Shatter—
and carry me—
you, a flock of crows upon a dead man's body, three decades risen from this scorched earth.
Away from the seas whose mother calls forevermore, through the saltmarshes and swamps and springs and streams, I fly!
Parousia!

*Therein lives a monster, confined in solitary for all eternity.*
*We may never kill him, but may remove him from our here and now.*
